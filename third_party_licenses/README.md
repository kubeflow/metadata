This folder contains a list of license file locations and types in `license_info.csv`  for all dependencies and transitive dependencies of the metadata docker image.

The actual license contents of all dependencies, `third_party/library/license.txt` shall be generated via the following command:
```
$ python concatenate_license.py --output=../third_party/library/license.txt
```

Whenever there is a dependency change of the metadata docker image, `license_info.csv` should be updated in the following steps.

# Generate the license information
Thanks to [kfp-license-tools](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/third_party/cli), we can gather the license information automatically for most dependencies.

## Setup
1. Download the [kfp_local_repository](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines) to your local folder `<kfp_local_repo>`.
2. Install `kfp-license-tools`.
    ```
    $ python <kfp_local_repo>/third_party/cli/setup.py install
    ```
3. We will do all the work under `third_party_licenses` folder:

    ```
    $ cd kubeflow/metadata/third_party_licenses
    ```

## Get all dependency repositories
1. Get all Golang dependencies from Go module and save it into `dep.txt`.

    ```
    $ go list -m all | cut -d ' ' -f 1 > dep.txt
    ```

2. Get the repository URL for each dependency via this command:
    ```
    $ python <kfp_local_repo>/third_party/cli/get_github_repo.py

    ......
    Successfully resolved github repo for 89 dependencies and saved to repo.txt. Failed to resolve 3 dependencies.
    We failed to resolve the following dependencies:
    gomodules.xyz/jsonpatch/v2
    honnef.co/go/tools
    ml_metadata
    ```

3. Create a CSV for unknown repositories.

    As you can see, there are 3 dependencies that can not be resolved automatically from the previous step. We have to search for these repositories manually and add a CSV file `dep_repo.manual.csv` for future runs.

    Rerun the command in step 2 to resolve all repositories this time:
    ```
    $ python <kfp_local_repo>/third_party/cli/get_github_repo.py

    ......
    Successfully resolved github repo for 92 dependencies and saved to repo.txt. Failed to resolve 0 dependencies.
    ```

## Get all license URLs and types

1. Get all license information by this command:
    ```
    $ python <kfp_local_repo>/third_party/cli/get_github_license_info.py --github-api-token-file=<github_token_file>
    ......
    Fetching license for google/ml-metadata
    Fetching license for kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime
    Fetching license for kubernetes-sigs/testing_frameworks
    Fetching license for kubernetes-sigs/yaml
    Fetched github license info, 91 succeeded, 0 failed.
    ```
    You have to create a `<github_token_file>` in order to access Github repositories. You shall see `license_info.csv` file produced.

2. Update license types.


    If you open `license_info.csv`, you can see some fields are marked as `Other`. We have to update them to the right license types. First we need to grep all these unknown license URLs:
    ```
    $ cat license_info.csv | grep Other | cut -d ',' -f 2

    GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-golang,https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/master/LICENSE,Other,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/master/LICENSE
    ghodss/yaml,https://github.com/ghodss/yaml/blob/master/LICENSE,Other,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghodss/yaml/master/LICENSE
    gogo/protobuf,https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/master/LICENSE,Other,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gogo/protobuf/master/LICENSE
    ......
    ```

    Now we can open these license all at once in Chrome via a plugin called [OpenList](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openlist/nkpjembldfckmdchbdiclhfedcngbgnl?hl=en).

    After checking the license content one by one, we can now create `additional_license_info.csv` to record the right license types. The content  of `additional_license_info.csv` looks like this:
    ```
    https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/master/LICENSE,Apache License 2.0
    https://github.com/ghodss/yaml/blob/master/LICENSE,MIT
    https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/master/LICENSE,BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License
    ......
    ```

    Finally, we can patch the additional license types in `additional_license_info.csv` on `license_info.csv` to get the final list of licenses with types.

    ```
    $  python patch_additional_license_info.py
    ```

## Dependency source code
We have to mirror source code in the image under `third_party` for code with MPL, EPL, GPL or CDDL licenses. We don't have the such dependencies right now.
